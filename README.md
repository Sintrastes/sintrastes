### About me

Welcome to my github profile!

I have a wide variety of interests in sofrware development, from functional programming and type theory, formal methods, logic programming, security, GIS, and game development, to UI/UX development. So if you see something that interests you on one of my personal projects, feel free to reach out. Pull requests welcome.

- üó®Ô∏è I use he/him pronouns.
- üì´ How to reach me: nbedell@tulane.edu
- ‚úèÔ∏è I write [a blog](https://sintrastes.github.io/blog/archive.html) about math and programming sometimes.
- üìö My academic interests also include [linugistics](https://github.com/Sintrastes/Montague), and [microtonal music theory](https://github.com/Sintrastes/xen-toolbox).
- üí° Ask me about [graded categories](https://digitallibrary.tulane.edu/islandora/object/tulane%3A90929/datastream/PDF/view).
- üå≥ When I'm not working on cool software projects, I like cooking, music, playing video games, and exploring the outdoors.

### What's in a name?
